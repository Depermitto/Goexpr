#+title: Goexpr

* This little CLI program is a test for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree?useskin=vector][Ast]] capabilities in calculating simple math problems.
Works as a normal calculator with operator priority and parenthesis. Features a simple parser of mine own creation. To run the program simply ~go run main.go~.
